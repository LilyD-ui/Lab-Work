  <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
  <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if this page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
 
  <!-- add a long line here --> <hr>

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure of what is being written. 
        <br /> There may be sub-sub-headings <dfn>(or lower-level headings).</dfn></p>

    <p>What should this be?</p>

    <h3>Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>Here you can see another sub-heading. <br /> But should this be a heading? Probably not. Too much info/text now. <br /> right?</p>

    <!-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to break sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of a paragraph and see what happens in your browser-->

    <h4>And Another Sub-Heading</h4>
    <p> <em>More headings?? </em> Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag.</p>

    <h5>Yet Another Sub-Heading</h5>
    <p>That's a lot of headings. Here you can see another sub-heading. You know what to do now.  Make this <strong> WORD </strong> strong aka bold. Give it a proper tag!</p>

    <!-- add a long line here --> <hr>

    <!-- add the proper tags to change "th" and "2" below -->

    Today is the 4<sup>th</sup> of July and there is a lot of C0<sub>2</sub> in the air.

    <!-- try using the "abbr" tag just like it's used in the book for the line below --> 

    <p><br> In case you were wondering, here is <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> John Doe's address!</p>

    <!-- Make each line for the address appears on a new line, starting with the name -->
 
    <p><strong>John Doe</strong></p>
    <address>
        <p>14000 Fruitvale Ave</p>
        
        <p>Saratoga, CA 95070</p>
    </address>
